*This application helps you analyzing the location, depth and magnitude of earthquakes off Fiji, using the quakes dataset from [R].*

*First, you need to set the minimum threshold of number of stations reporting the earthquakes. These information will be used to filter out earthquakes don't meet the requirement.*

*Second, you can drag the slider bar to select the range of earthquake depth and earthquake maginitude you want to include.*

*After you set the values, this application will show you a map of Fiji with circles stand for each earthquake, the radius of circle stands for different value. You could choose to see two differenent types of map: OpenStreetMap or MapQuestOpen.Aerial.
